# Assignment 2: Hierarchical Modeling & SSD
<br>

In this assignment, I implemented the following functionalities:
* Rendered skeleton using hierarchical modeling:
  * Local-to-world transformation for all joints;
  * Optimization for computing transformation using an implicit matrix stack;
  * Handled UI to update skeleton positions & rotations;

* Implemented skeleton subspace deformation (SSD):
  * Attached skin mesh to skeleton, where each vertex is attached to neighboring joints according to attachment weights;
  * Computed normals (per-face normals, and then per-vertex normals) for shading;

* Wired the `S` key to toggle between skeleton view & SSD view.

### Compile & Run Code

I followed the steps on the assignment page to compile and run my code, and I didn't run into any compilation error.

### Collaboration

I went to Office Hours a couple times for debugging. I collaborated with Liane Xu and Karen Ma on some parts.

### References

As I was trying out the texture mapping extra-credit problem, I referenced [this Learn OpenGL article](https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Textures), as well as [this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdn1y5Yq424&ab_channel=LearningOpenGL).

### Known Problems with My Code

There is no known problem with my code.

### Extra Credit

I attempted an easy extra-credit problem on texture mapping (but didn't really work).
