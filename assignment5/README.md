# Assignment 5: Shadow Mapping
<br>

In this assignment, I implemented the following functionalities:
* Build a scene tree (first without texture);
* Create OpenGL texture objects, and user shader to sample from the texture using UV coordinates;
* Render shadows in real-time using shadow mapping.
<br><br>


### Compile & Run Code

I followed the steps on the assignment page to compile and run my code, and I didn't run into any compilation error. I used MacOS.

### Collaboration

I collaborated with Liane Xu and Karen Ma for general debugging. I went to Office Hours a couple times.
<br><br>


### References

I used the [LearnOpenGL tutorial](https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-Lighting/Shadows/Shadow-Mapping) for calculating shadow map.

### Known Problems with My Code

There is no known problem with my code. **Image of the rendered scene is in the root directory**.
