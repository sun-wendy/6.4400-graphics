# Assignment 4: Ray Tracing
<br>

In this assignment, I implemented the following functionalities:
* Point light sources & the Phong shading model;
* Planes & triangles for ray tracing;
* Recursive ray tracing & shadows.
<br><br>


### Compile & Run Code

I followed the steps on the assignment page to compile and run my code, and I didn't run into any compilation error. I used MacOS.
<br><br>


### Collaboration

I collaborated with Liane Xu and Karen Ma for general debugging. I went to Office Hours a couple times.
<br><br>


### References

No outside reference used.
<br><br>


### Known Problems with My Code

There is no known problem with my code. **Images of the rendered scenes are in the root directory**.
<br><br>
One thing to note is that to keep the line from appearing in `scene06` (as mentioned in Piazza posts), I modified the `octree` implementation as instructed by the Piazza post.
<br><br>
