# Assignment 0: OpenGL Mesh Viewer
<br>

In this assignment, I implemented the following functionalities:
* Wired the `C` key to toggle through several colors for teapot;
* Wired the arrow keys to change the position of the point light;
* Added a directional light to the scene.
<br><br>

### Compile & Run Code

I followed the steps on the assignment page to compile and run my code, and I didn't run into any compilation error.

### Collaboration

I went to Office Hours a couple times for debugging and questions about GLOO structure. I also collaborated with Emily Zhang on creating a new TeapotNode, as we were trying to figure out the general structure of GLOO and how to use the library.

### References

I didn't use any outside reference for this assignment, except for the assignment document given to us, which introduces the GLOO library.

### Known Problems with My Code

There is no known problem with my code.

### Extra Credit

I didn't do extra credit problem this time.

### Comments

I enjoyed this assignment overall, as it was interactive and I got to visually see the outcome of my code on the teapot rendered. However, the lack of documentation for GLOO made it inconvenient to use the library â€” having a documentation would be much better in terms of introducing the structure and usage of GLOO.
